Here the houses are vague dispirited dark-eyed shapes hunkered against the cold. The wheels of the car slide a little in the slush, but I keep my small battered Toyota from hitting the curb and offer the girls a reassuring smile neither of them sees.\n\n    Then my home, which looks no less unwelcoming than any of the others, and I kill the engine. Listen for a moment to the ticking of the snow against the windshield as it tries to erase the outside world. Listen for a moment to the hitching breath from Isabelle's mouth as she struggles not to cry. Listen to the sniffling as Kara bravely fights with a cold.\n\n\"All right girls… We're here! \"\n4.

It's always warm in here, but today I set the thermostat higher knowing the kids would be coming back with me. I guess I didn't think getting them here would take as long as it did.\n2. I stamp snow from my shoes and offer them reassuring smiles though it hurts my heart to see them standing close together as if seeking solace from some terrible threat. Nightly I relive the warm cherished memories of their faces lighting up at the sight of me coming home from work, especially on Christmas Eve, my arms laden with gifts I made a show of pretending were not for them. I remember the clean scent of them as they wrapped their arms around me, the softness of their lips against my cheek, the laughter, the joy.\n3.

I promised them gifts last Christmas and on their birthdays and forgot on each occasion thanks to self-pity and a bottle with a man's name on the label.\n2. So I expected wariness and doubt.

I notice they've moved closer together though. Kara's hand has found its way into the crook of her sister's arm. Isabelle has her gloved hands shoved into her pockets. Both of them have their hoods still up.\n\nI turn back to the meals. Maybe the smell of food will entice them to join me. \" Not quite as fancy as the dinners your Mom makes, \" I explain as I set the timer. \" But I think you'll like it.

That if she understood what life in this shithole little apartment has been like without her, without Kara, without her mother and the affection with which they used to treat me, that she would forgive me my trespasses and rush into my arms. She would gladly accept the gift I bought her then. She would gladly accept me as part of her life again. She would care.\n2. I weep, silently, as I unwrap the gift. I'm blocking it from her view, so she can't see what it is. But that hardly matters now, does it? It could be a pony, a car, a million dollars, and it wouldn't matter. She only wants her mother.\n\n \" It's a cell phone, \" I whisper, running a finger over the small rectangular box. \" An expensive one. I bought it… \" My throat closes, trapping a sob. I wait. Try again. \"… I bought it and programmed my number into it so that, even if you didn't want to talk… you could send me a text now and then. \" The sobs come, wave after wave of them rippling through me as I push the gift aside and reach for Kara's. I can barely see it through the ugly orange and dazzling white kaleidoscope the tears have made of my eyes. Blinking furiously, I tear open the wrapping paper and roughly fling it aside.\n3. \" For you, Kara, honey. \" I raise the box to show it to her. I am heartened to hear her give the slightest gasp. \" A Sassy Sarah doll. The clerk at the store told me they're the coolest thing out there right now. \" I continue to hold it up for a moment, waiting, wanting her to take it. When she doesn't, I let it fall to the floor and stand, my knees cracking painfully.\n4.
